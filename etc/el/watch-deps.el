;; Comments:
;; 
;; Simple ELISP program that automatically executes a configurable shell command
;; whenever a buffer is saved whose file name is in the
;; `watch-deps-file-list'. The file name compared against in
;; `watch-deps-watch-hook' is constructed by prepending
;; `watch-deps-base-dir'. This latter variable thus refers to the project's root
;; directory.
;; 
;; The buffer specified by `watch-deps-output-buffer' is shown if the executed
;; command, specified by the `watch-deps-command' variable produces any output
;; to STDERR.
;;
;; After loading this program with `load-library', issue:
;; customize-group RET
;; watch-deps RET
;;
;; Then proceed to configuring the variables `Watch Deps Base Dir´ and `Watch
;; Deps Command´, without which this program will not run. Note that the value
;; for `Watch Deps Base Dir´ does require to be wrapped within double quotes as
;; its type is directory.
