Analysts predicted a weak turnout and few results by the end of the summit.`` No one expects much from this summit,&#39;&#39; Mohammed Sayed Said, editor in chief of Egyptian daily Al - Badeel told AFP, anticipating little more than a broad final statement calling for`` Lebanon&#39;s national unity or some such.&#39;&#39; Egypt&#39;s state-owned daily <b class=\"treelab.mention\">Al</b> <b class=\"treelab.mention\">-</b> <b class=\"treelab.mention\">Ahram</b> said in an editorial on Sunday that the Lebanese crisis seems to have polarised member states.`` This summit will be one that confirms Arab differences instead of being a summit of Arab unity in these times.&#39;&#39; But earlier this week Abul Gheit refused to acknowledge the existence of different camps within the Arab League.`` You ca n&#39;t say that. Arabs must represent only one axis,&#39;&#39; Abul Gheit told the Wighet Nazar television programme, while acknowledging that`` the Egyptian, Saudi and Jordanian views often meet.&#39;&#39; But he

year the pressure was even more intense amid reports that some exam questions were not part of the curriculum and that papers were leaked in advance to rich and powerful parents. Public prosecutor Abdel Meguid Mahmud told reporters last week that 19 people would face trial for leaking exam papers, including a police officer, a headmaster and three education ministry employees. The prosecutor insisted to a disbelieving public that the corruption was limited to the southern province of Menya and did not affect most of the roughly 800,000 students sitting the exam. The case has gripped the nation, bringing together state and opposition media in a rare show of unity to demand answers. Columnists have demanded a re-sit, with teachers and academics supporting them. Mostafa Kamal Mohammed Yussuf, a professor of science at Mansura University and head of the committee that wrote the national physics textbook, admitted to the state-owned daily <b class=\"treelab.mention\">Al</b> <b class=\"treelab.mention\">-</b> <b class=\"treelab.mention\">Ahram</b> that the exams were too difficult and did not correspond to the curriculum.

NEWS STORY 2003-05-21 Egypt calls for`` new vision&#39;&#39; to save torn Arab League by Acil Tabbara Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher urged Wednesday Arab League member-states to find a`` new vision&#39;&#39; to save their grouping, which emerged more divided than ever from the US -led war in Iraq. Officials at the Cairo -based league meanwhile said that proposals were being floated on how to reform the 22-member organization, with some taking inspiration from the European Union.`` We must not change or replace the Arab League, but undertake reforms which would help avoid its negative aspects,&#39;&#39; Maher said in remarks published in <b class=\"treelab.mention\">Al</b> <b class=\"treelab.mention\">-</b> <b class=\"treelab.mention\">Ahram</b> and other government-run newspapers. There are`` proposals from several Arab members, including Saudi Arabia, Libya and Egypt to develop the Arab League,&#39;&#39; Maher said. Including close allies of the United States and maverick Arab states, the organization emerged more divided than ever from the diplomatic standoffs which preceded the war in Iraq. But Maher said that despite its negative points, no member-state was looking to do away with the organization.`` Egypt has not seen any Arab country that is determined to destroy the Arab League,&#39;&#39; he said. He added that differences between Arab League Secretary General Amr Mussa and an Arab country he did not specify had largely been resolved, in an apparent allusion to Kuwait, which served as a launchpad to the US -led invasion of Iraq on March 20.":1},"bow_VBZ":{"is":1,"has":1,"calls":1},"bol_MD":{"would":1,"must":1},"bow-PER_lemma_100":{},"co_MISC":{"aspects":1,"allusion":1,"that":1,"differences":1,"afp eng 20030521 0507 ldc2007t07":1,"undertake":1,"reforms":1,"remarks":1,"invasion":1,"news":1,"grouping":1,"change":1,"standoffs":1,"story":1,"launchpad":1,"proposals":2,"wednesday":1,"foreign":1,"march":1,"points":1,"member states":1,"inspiration":1,"maverick":1,"war":2,"vision":2,"secretary":1},"bol_JJR":{"more":2},"bol_DT":{"a":2,"no":1,"the":13,"some":1,"any":1,"an":2},"bow_NNS":{"aspects":1,"newspapers":1,"differences":1,"proposals":2,"states":1,"officials":1,"member states":1,"members":1,"reforms":1,"remarks":1,"allies":1,"points":1,"standoffs":1},"bow_NNP":{"":1,"egypt":3,"cairo":1,"al":1,"general":1,"arab":6,"acil":1,"afp eng 20030521 0507 ldc2007t07":1,"tabbara":1,"arabia":1,"news":1,"amr":1,"ahram":1,"league":6,"ahmed":1,"iraq":3,"story":1,"libya":1,"union":1,"kuwait":1,"european":1,"us":2,"foreign":1,"mussa":1,"saudi":1,"maher":4,"secretary":1,"minister":1},"abs_url_m":{"/data/TAC-KBP/LDC2010E12/TAC_2010_KBP_Source_Data/data/2009/nw/afp_eng/20030521/AFP_ENG_20030521.0507.LDC2007T07.sgm#c2b3+2,c2b5+1,c2b6+5":1},"bow_CC":{"and":4,"or":1,"but":2},"bow_CD":{"20":1},"bow_RBR":{},"bow_IN":{"on":2,"from":4,"for":1,"that":4,"of":2,"despite":1,"than":2,"as":1,"at":1,"in":5,"between":1,"with":2,"by":1},"bow_WRB":{"how":1},"bol_POS":{},"bow_PRP":{"we":1,"he":3},"bow-all_lemma_1000":{},"bol_VB":{"develop":1,"help":1,"avoid":1,"replace":1,"close":1,"destroy":1,"save":2,"find":1,"specify":1},"stream_id":{"1395342964-a918fbd3df7582b19fc0795cf126141f":1},"co_PER":{"ahmed":1,"acil":1,"members":1,"general":1,"mussa":1,"officials":1,"minister":1,"maher":4,"tabbara":1,"amr":1}}},{"labels":[],"node_id":"sid_1395342968-0608ab9b726a8077797062b03341404c#c1194+2,c1196+1,c1197+5","children":[],"name":"","features":{"bonp":{"protests":1,"leaders":1,"egypt":2,"demonstrations":1,"month":1,"attempts":1,"provocateurs":1,"movements":1,"provinces":1,"muslim brotherhood":1,"business":1,"acts":1,"percent":1,"establishments":1,"household expenditure":1,"strike":3,"afp":1,"movement":1,"rumours":1,"price hikes":1,"part":1,"schools":1,"factories":1,"world food programme":1,"attempt":1,"ministry":2,"kefaya":1,"firm measures":1,"face prison":1,"road traffic":1,"un":1,"institutions":1},"bow-all_lemma_1000":{},"bol_CC":{"and":7,"or":2,"but":1},"stream_id_m":{"1395342968-0608ab9b726a8077797062b03341404c#c1194+2,c1196+1,c1197+5":1},"abs_url":{"/data/TAC-KBP/LDC2010E12/TAC_2010_KBP_Source_Data/data/2009/nw/afp_eng/20080406/AFP_ENG_20080406.0153.LDC2009T13.sgm":1},"bow_VBD":{"said":2,"warned":1,"insisted":1,"threatened":1,"told":1,"had":1},"labels":{"ORG-NIL0012":1},"bow_VBN":{"supported":1,"accused":1,"called":2,"risen":1,"outlawed":1},"con_post_3":{"strike":1,"prison":1,"face":1},"co_MISC":{"state owned":1,"protests":1,"household":1,"demonstrations":1,"sit in":1,"attempts":1,"saturday":1,"movements":1,"provinces":1,"rumours":1,"incite":1,"acts":1,"percent":1,"establishments":1,"sunday":1,"spread":1,"strike":3,"movement":1,"firm":1,"business":1,"price":1,"measures":1,"running":1,"part":1,"traffic":1,"month":1,"those":1,"attempt":1,"january":1,"face":1,"hikes":1,"expenditure":1,"the":1,"road":1},"con_post_1":{"strike":1},"bol_DATE-NNP":{"january":1,"sunday":1,"saturday":1},"co_GPE":{"egypt":2},"bol_PRP$":{"its":1},"bow_NN":{"firm":1,"business":1,"household":1,"month":1,"part":1,"traffic":1,"attempt":1,"ministry":2,"incite":1,"percent":1,"face":1,"spread":1,"prison":1,"strike":3,"expenditure":1,"price":1,"road":1,"movement":1},"sentences":{"On Saturday the interior ministry threatened`` immediate and firm measures against any attempt to demonstrate, disrupt road traffic or the running of public establishments and against all attempts to incite such acts.&#39;&#39; The interior ministry insisted that all public institutions, including schools and state-run factories, should open for business as usual.

NEWS STORY 2008-03-27 Bush voices ` deep regret&#39; at Egypt shooting : White House US President George W. Bush called his Egyptian counterpart Hosni Mubarak Thursday to express regret over the killing of an Egyptian by a US -navy chartered vessel, a White House official said.`` President Bush expressed his deep regret and sympathies for the incident in the Suez Canal and said the United States will fully investigate this,&#39;&#39; White House national security council spokesman Gordon Johndroe said. On Monday Mohammed Moqtar Afifi was killed and two Egyptians were wounded when the Global Patriot, a transport vessel chartered by the US Navy waiting to cross the Suez Canal, fired warning shots at a small boat trying to sell merchandise nearby. Earlier Egypt&#39;s official news agency MENA reported that Bush told Mubarak he hoped the tragic incident would not affect the friendly relations between the two countries and that he had asked the Pentagon to probe the shooting. Egypt&#39;s Foreign Minister Ahmed Abul Gheit however said the shooting was`` unacceptable&#39;&#39; and that`` Egyptian ports are not open to those who want to fire shots,&#39;&#39; the state-run <b class=\"treelab.mention\">Al</b> <b class=\"treelab.mention\">-</b> <b class=\"treelab.mention\">Ahram</b> newspaper reported Thursday.`` The Egyptian boat may have approached in a manner that concerned the Americans, but that&#39;s no reason to fire shots in Egyptian territorial waters,&#39;&#39; he said in the first official Egyptian reaction to the incident.`` We accept American apologies but the rights of Egyptian citizens must be guaranteed and Egyptian territory and waters must be respected.&#39;&#39; US officials initially said there were no casualties from the incident, insisting that all warning shots were accounted for as having hit the water. On Wednesday, they admitted that one man had been killed and agreed to pay compensation. The commander of the US Navy&#39;s Fifth Fleet, the US State Department and the US ambassador to Cairo have expressed regret over the incident.":1},"bol_MD":{"will":1,"may":1,"would":1,"must":2},"bow-PER_lemma_100":{},"co_MISC":{"regret":1,"afp eng 20080327 0398 ldc2009t13":1,"probe":1,"wednesday":1,"deep":1,"voices":1,"warning":2,"thursday":2,"apologies":1,"shooting":2,"transport":1,"story":1,"relations":1,"tragic":1,"sympathies":1,"monday":1,"fire":2,"waters":1,"killing":1,"water":1,"reason":1,"news":2,"casualties":1,"merchandise":1,"reaction":1,"rights":1,"this":1,"official":2,"incident":5,"foreign":1,"compensation":1,"shots":4,"the":1,"manner":1},"bow-all_lemma_1000":{},"bol_DT":{"a":5,"all":1,"no":2,"this":1,"the":26,"those":1,"an":1},"bow_NNS":{"sympathies":1,"rights":1,"waters":2,"citizens":1,"relations":1,"voices":1,"officials":1,"shots":4,"apologies":1,"countries":1,"casualties":1,"ports":1},"bow_NNP":{"":1,"egypt":3,"afp eng 20080327 0398 ldc2009t13":1,"global":1,"gheit":1,"al":1,"council":1,"president":2,"navy":2,"pentagon":1,"george":1,"fifth":1,"canal":2,"johndroe":1,"story":1,"mubarak":2,"state":1,"moqtar":1,"hosni":1,"bush":4,"house":3,"department":1,"white":3,"mena":1,"ahram":1,"abul":1,"ahmed":1,"afifi":1,"minister":1,"news":1,"suez":2,"patriot":1,"cairo":1,"mohammed":1,"us":7,"foreign":1,"american":1,"gordon":1,"w":1,"fleet":1,"security":1},"abs_url_m":{"/data/TAC-KBP/LDC2010E12/TAC_2010_KBP_Source_Data/data/2009/nw/afp_eng/20080327/AFP_ENG_20080327.0398.LDC2009T13.sgm#c4cb+2,c4cd+1,c4ce+5":1},"bow_CC":{"and":9,"but":2},"bow_CD":{"two":2,"one":1},"bow_RBR":{"earlier":1},"bol_WP":{"who":1},"bow_IN":{"on":2,"from":1,"for":2,"that":7,"of":3,"over":2,"between":1,"as":1,"at":2,"in":4,"by":2},"bow_WRB":{"when":1},"bol_POS":{"":1,"s":4},"bow_PRP":{"we":1,"they":1,"he":3},"bol_VB":{"sell":1,"be":2,"regret":4,"pay":1,"express":1,"cross":1,"accept":1,"investigate":1,"affect":1},"stream_id":{"1395342968-c1d6e4590c6bf18207a5e2916b32e58c":1},"co_PER":{"ambassador":1,"his":2,"egyptian":1,"hosni":1,"abul":1,"who":1,"gheit":1,"commander":1,"afifi":1,"officials":1,"americans":1,"minister":1,"they":1,"egyptians":1,"president":2,"moqtar":1,"george":1,"those":1,"man":1,"johndroe":1,"ahmed":1,"mubarak":2,"citizens":1,"mohammed":1,"spokesman":1,"bush":4,"official":1,"counterpart":1,"gordon":1}}},{"labels":[],"node_id":"sid_1395342968-d795e7446b15da30be172e8a162d48b4#c1064+2,c1066+1,c1067+5","children":[],"name":"","features":{"bonp":{"protests":1,"backing":1,"year":1,"demonstrations":2,"month":1,"attempts":1,"provocateurs":1,"movements":1,"business":1,"acts":1,"percent":1,"national democratic party":1,"establishments":1,"egypt":2,"unions":1,"household expenditure":1,"strike":3,"weeks":1,"food prices":1,"rumours":1,"strikes":1,"wave":1,"schools":1,"factories":1,"world food programme":1,"attempt":1,"ministry":2,"firm measures":1,"road traffic":1,"un":1,"jail":1,"ruling":1,"institutions":1},"bow-all_lemma_1000":{},"bol_CC":{"and":9,"or":2},"stream_id_m":{"1395342968-d795e7446b15da30be172e8a162d48b4#c1064+2,c1066+1,c1067+5":1},"abs_url":{"/data/TAC-KBP/LDC2010E12/TAC_2010_KBP_Source_Data/data/2009/nw/afp_eng/20080406/AFP_ENG_20080406.0080.LDC2009T13.sgm":1},"bow_VBD":{"met":1,"said":1,"threatened":1,"warned":1,"insisted":1,"had":1},"labels":{"ORG-NIL0012":1},"bow_VBN":{"accused":1,"risen":1,"considered":1,"linked":1,"been":2,"called":1},"con_post_3":{"strike":1,"world":1,"jail":1},"co_MISC":{"state owned":1,"protests":1,"backing":1,"sky":1,"household":1,"demonstrations":2,"month":1,"attempts":1,"year":1,"saturday":1,"movements":1,"business":1,"incite":1,"acts":1,"percent":1,"establishments":1,"sunday":1,"spread":1,"strike":3,"weeks":1,"firm":1,"rumours":1,"food":1,"measures":1,"strikes":1,"wave":1,"running":1,"traffic":1,"prices":1,"attempt":1,"january":1,"expenditure":1,"road":1},"con_post_1":{"strike":1},"bow_WDT":{"which":1},"bow_VBP":{"are":1,"have":2},"co_GPE":{"egypt":2},"bol_PRP$":{},"bow_NN":{"firm":1,"business":1,"backing":1,"household":1,"wave":1,"traffic":1,"year":1,"month":1,"attempt":1,"ministry":2,"incite":1,"percent":1,"food":1,"spread":1,"jail":1,"ruling":1,"strike":3,"expenditure":1,"road":1},"sentences":{"A strike would have been considered illegal without the backing of unions which are linked mainly to the ruling National Democratic Party.
