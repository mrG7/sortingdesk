2014-10-10  Miguel Guedes  <miguel@miguelguedes.org>

	* src/main/SortingDesk.js:

	Added support for sub-bins. Sub-bins can now be created, queried,
	dragged and dropped, and removed.

	Implemented a number of deep-search methods for querying multiple
	aspects about top-level bins and their children.

	Sorting Desk now allows the client to specify factory methods
	for construction of classes but also classes via the
	`options.constructors' setting.

	The usual several minor improvements to code.

	* css:

	Moved styling pertaining to sub-bins away from Sorting Desk's
	internal style sheet.

	* examples:

	Logic now in place that ensures Sorting Desk instantiates itself
	correctly.

	Added examples of sub-bins.

	* src/api/api-sorting_desk-mock.js:

	Added support for initialisation and querying of sub bin data.

2014-10-09  Miguel Guedes  <miguel@miguelguedes.org>

	* src/main/SortingDesk.js:

	Implemented "constructors", employing the factory method pattern,
	for instantiation of public classes.

	Finished generic mechanism responsible for resetting the Sorting
	Desk instance reliably.

	Merged classes `BinBase', `Bin', and `SubBin'. There is only one
	class now, `Bin'.

	Renamed old `Generic'-suffixed classes to `Default' suffix.

	Several minor improvements to code.

	* examples:

	Created a mechanism for creating examples as modules. Examples can
	now be crafted easily as a module. It is also easy to switch
	between examples by selecting desired example from a select box.

	Deleted extraneous examples.

2014-10-02  Miguel Guedes  <miguel@miguelguedes.org>

	* src/main/SortingDesk.js:

	Effort made towards decoupling the different components that are
	part of Sorting Desk. This has led to the creation of a number of
	classes, namely:

	+ InstanceResetter: resets Sorting Desk's state (still to be
	finalised) in a rather intelligent fashion.

	+ ControllerCallbacks: handling of notifications to or issuing to
	callbacks. I'm actually thinking of creating a class employing the
	Publish-Subscribe pattern for notification of interesting events
	such as when a bin is deleted, a text item assigned to a bin, etc,
	and keeping this class strictly for the purpose of contacting Api
	methods dealing with server requests. Right now this class does
	both and that's wrong from a OOD perspective.

	+ ControllerRequests: responsible for keeping track of ongoing
	requests. A request is classed as such if it is custom specified
	by a Sorting Desk class instance, or if a callback invocation
	results in a promise being returned.

	+ ControllerButtonDismiss: activation/deactivation of the text
	item/bin dismissal button and drag'n'drop support.

	+ ControllerKeyboard: global keyboard event listener and processor
	of keyboard initiated events.

	+ ControllerBins: manager of bins.

	+ BinBase: base class of every bin, parent or child.

	+ Bin: base class of parent bins.

	+ BinGeneric: generic, default, implementation of the Bin class.

	+ SubBin: base class of children bins.

	+ SubBinGeneric: generic, default, implementation of the SubBin class.

	+ ControllerItems: manager of text items.

	+ TextItem: base class of text items.

	+ TextItemGeneric: generic, default, implementation of the TextItem class.

	+ BinAddButton: generic, default, implementation of the bin add
	button feature. Can be specialised and methods overriden for
	customised behaviour.

	In addition, a general effort was made to normalise and bring
	consistency to the interface, and getter methods were
	introduced. "Abstract" base classes `Owned', `Controller' and
	`Drawable' were created with a view to enforce interfaces to
	specialised classes.

	Lastly, made usual fixes and improvements to code.

	* css:

	Additional improvements to styling.

2014-10-01  Miguel Guedes  <miguel@miguelguedes.org>

	* all:

	Usual minor improvements and fixes to code.

	* css:

	Pre-pend `sd' to CSS classes required or expected by Sorting Desk.

	* src/main/SortingDesk.js:

	Sorting Desk now employs a unified bin model, whereby there is no
	distinction between bins. Although there is no difference in bin
	types, a bin may still be parent to one or more bins -- not
	implemented yet, although infrastructure already has been laid
	down for this purpose.

	Simplified use of CSS.

	Integrated text rendering and snippeting into component. Text
	rendering is now offered by default if a custom callback function
	isn't specified.

	Server requests and general load events are now triggered via a
	callback. Similarly, a callback is invoked after the request has
	terminated.

	Created derivable `Bin' and `TextItem' classes. These need further
	work before they can be specialised outside of Sorting Desk.

	Reverted to a design close to Object Oriented. This change
	retains the Module pattern and full UMD compliance but does away
	with the Revealing Module pattern in order to enable
	specialisation of generic classes by clients.

	* examples:

	Created an example illustrating simple instantiation of Sorting Desk.

	Simplified instantiation of the component in all examples.

2014-09-30  Miguel Guedes  <miguel@miguelguedes.org>

	* all:

	Begin moving styling specific to Sorting Desk into own CSS source
	file.

	* src/main/SortingDesk.js:

	Allow component to be instantiated multiple times.

	Begin simplifying component instantiation.

	Ensure code falls within the 80 columns limit.

	Minor improvements and fixes to code.

	* test:

	Adjust tests to reflect new instantiation requirements.

	Fix failing tests.

2014-09-18  Miguel Guedes  <miguel@miguelguedes.org>

	* test:

	Wrote additional tests. There are a total of 35 tests.

	* src/main/SortingDesk.js:

	Duration of special effects can now be customised.

	Text items' and bins' ids are now escaped as they may potentially
	contain characters that may cause errors.

	* all:

	Various minor improvements and fixes.

2014-09-16  Miguel Guedes  <miguel@miguelguedes.org>

	* jasmine:

	Move jasmine into `lib' directory.

	* tests:

	Fix jasmine instantiating its UI twice. Also fixed an issue
	causing `setup' not to be available to test specs due to `init.js'
	being loaded after one or more specs.

	Wrote additional tests. Of note is support for testing of HTML5
	drag and drop events.

	* all:

	Several minor improvements and fixes, as usual.

2014-09-15  Miguel Guedes  <miguel@miguelguedes.org>

	* all:

	Add support for RequireJs. `SortingDesk.js',
	`api-sorting_desk-mock.js' (and its fake data), and the unit tests
	can now be entirely loaded via RequireJs. Compatibility with
	traditional declarative loading method retained.

	Moved external libraries into a single location, with symbolic
	links now used to point to them.

	Several minor improvements and fixes.

	* tests:

	Wrote additional tests.

	* src/main/SortingDesk.js:

	Added check to ensure `reset' isn't called multiple times.

2014-09-12  Miguel Guedes  <miguel@miguelguedes.org>

	* all:

	Reworked code so it employs the Module design pattern. Added a few
	public methods for clients to use.

	Added jsdoc comments where applicable.

	Created a basic makefile for generation of documentation from the
	code. Minification of javascript is not yet performed as a
	minification tool needs to be first selected.

	Reworked code so as to allow tests to be executed empirically and
	in a fail proof fashion. This required several changes to be made,
	some of which to plug bizarre executions flows that became
	apparent due to the async nature of the tests employed.

	Create base infrastructure for reliable deployment of unit tests.

	Wrote additional tests.

	Various minor improvements.

2014-09-09  Miguel Guedes  <miguel@miguelguedes.org>

	* test:

	Added infrastructure allowing for the deployment of unit
	tests. Handful of initial unit tests also added.

	* all:

	Reorganised directory structure.

	Component is now able to operate without the bin delete button.

	Renamed the `test' directory to `examples' to make way for the
	actual unit tests.

	Other minor improvements.

2014-09-06  Miguel Guedes  <miguel@miguelguedes.org>

	* src/main/SortingDesk.js:

	Simplified and standardised HTML5 drag and drop, which now
	works in all major browsers.

	There are now two APIs, one using live data from Diffeo's servers
	and another making use of mock data. The mock API can be easily
	configurable to use a custom data set.

	Several minor improvements.

2014-09-05  Miguel Guedes  <miguel@miguelguedes.org>

	* src/main/SortingDesk.js:

	Removed reliance on hard-coded CSS classes.

	When removing a bin, it wasn't actually deleted from the internal
	data container. That's now been fixed.

	Text items can now be sorted into the button that was previously
	used to delete bins. Text items can, therefore, now be removed
	without being sorted into a specific bin.

	Component now fully uses HTML5 drag and drop. Reliance on jQuery's
	UI plugin has been dropped and the plugin removed from the
	repository.

	Changes were made to ensure that Sorting Desk can still function
	without a `bins' (HTML) container.

	Removed responsibilities for several UI related aspects. These are
	now the sole responsibility of the caller.

	Several improvements and minor fixes.

2014-08-22  Miguel Guedes  <miguel@miguelguedes.org>

	* all:

	Added initial foundation for a user notification mechanism.

	Minor improvements to code.

	* src/main/SortingDesk.js:

	The appropriate bin removal callback is now invoked when a bin is
	removed.

	Added initial support for bin ids to be passed to API bin addition
	callbacks when a user creates a bin based on an existing text
	item.

	* test/js/api-sorting_desk.js (Api):

	Created missing API method `removePrimarySubBin'.

	Fixed `removeSecondaryBin' actually not deleting bin from fake
	data repository.

2014-08-21  Miguel Guedes  <miguel@miguelguedes.org>

	* all:

	Several improvements to UI interaction made: text item node now
	forcibly selected when more/less link clicked; text item node is
	aligned to top if its height is larger than container; correct
	spacing ensured at bottom when repositioning; other minor
	enhancements.

	A few bugs, most of which introduced recently, were also fixed,
	namely: visually broken d'n'd of large text items; occasional
	vertical flicker when dragging items; enforce a single API request
	per kind; other minor bugs.

	Added UI notification when one or more AJAX requests are taking
	place.

	Implemented creation of secondary or sub bins via dragging and
	dropping of text items onto a 'bin add' button.

	Finalised text rendering algorithm. Component is now fully modular
	and much smarter. In particular, it is now able to skip over HTML
	tags and produces snippets with roughly equal number of chars to
	the left and right of the highlighted text.

	Implement actual deletion of bin elements from UI. Bin containers
	are now reorganised whenever a bin is deleted.

	Created subdirectory `doc' for project-related generic document
	files.

	Reorganised source files into individual subdirectories.

	Various improvements to code.


2014-08-20  Miguel Guedes  <miguel@miguelguedes.org>

	* all:

	Component is now able to retrieve information about primary bin
	from diffeo's RESTful API.

	A title was added to every text item in the form of a link
	(clicking opens a new tab).

	Implemented multi-view, word-bound text rendering
	algorithm. Depending on the current view, a "more" or "less" link
	is displayed which allows for rendering of a condensed or
	unrestricted view of a text item. There might be potentially a bug
	(untested) if the boundaries fall on opened tags (e.g. boundary
	ends after `<b class="foo">'); nothing major though and shouldn't
	affect rendering in any way.

	Component now loads live data from diffeo's RESTful API.

	Added logic for user notification of ongoing AJAX requests.

	A UI control was created that allows for real-time changing of the
	current primary bin's node id. Editing the field and exiting it
	triggers the new primary node id to take effect.

2014-08-14  Miguel Guedes  <miguel@miguelguedes.org>

	* src/SortingDesk.js:

	Created UI interaction logic permitting deletion of all
	non-primary bins. Deletion of bins is done by dragging intended
	bin. Once dragging is initiated a target with an `X' inside will
	pop up. Dropping the bin in to the target deletes it. Note,
	however, that no bins are actually deleted yet. Will be waiting
	approval of current implementation before actual bin removal logic
	is added.

	Separated `bin' and `bin containment' responsibilities. Required
	quite a bit of work.

	Implemented logic enabling interactive creation of bins. Bins are
	created by clicking the appropriate 'add' button and waiting for
	input from the user. If the user moves away from the new bin
	without entering a description/title, creation of the bin is
	cancelled. If a description/title has been entered, hitting TAB or
	ENTER, or moving away from the new bin results in the creation of
	a new bin.

	Reworked mechanism by which bins are created.  There were serious
	presentation issues involving bins whose titles/descriptions
	spanned more than one line.

	Bin animates when an item is assigned via a keyboard shortcut.

	Removed reliance on hardcoded CSS classes.

	* test/css/theme-default.css: Several clean up/improvements of CSS
	styling.
