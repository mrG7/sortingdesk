	* test:

	Added infrastructure allowing for the deployment of unit
	tests. Handful of initial unit tests also added.

	* all:

	Reorganised directory structure.

	Component is now able to operate without the bin delete button.

	Renamed the `test' directory to `examples' to make way for the
	actual unit tests.

	Other minor improvements.

2014-09-06  Miguel Guedes  <miguel@miguelguedes.org>

	* src/main/SortingDesk.js:

	Simplified and standardised HTML5 drag and drop, which now
	works in all major browsers.

	There are now two APIs, one using live data from Diffeo's servers
	and another making use of mock data. The mock API can be easily
	configurable to use a custom data set.

	Several minor improvements.

2014-09-05  Miguel Guedes  <miguel@miguelguedes.org>

	* src/main/SortingDesk.js:

	Removed reliance on hard-coded CSS classes.

	When removing a bin, it wasn't actually deleted from the internal
	data container. That's now been fixed.

	Text items can now be sorted into the button that was previously
	used to delete bins. Text items can, therefore, now be removed
	without being sorted into a specific bin.

	Component now fully uses HTML5 drag and drop. Reliance on jQuery's
	UI plugin has been dropped and the plugin removed from the
	repository.

	Changes were made to ensure that Sorting Desk can still function
	without a `bins' (HTML) container.

	Removed responsibilities for several UI related aspects. These are
	now the sole responsibility of the caller.

	Several improvements and minor fixes.

2014-08-22  Miguel Guedes  <miguel@miguelguedes.org>

	* all:

	Added initial foundation for a user notification mechanism.

	Minor improvements to code.

	* src/main/SortingDesk.js:

	The appropriate bin removal callback is now invoked when a bin is
	removed.

	Added initial support for bin ids to be passed to API bin addition
	callbacks when a user creates a bin based on an existing text
	item.

	* test/js/api-sorting_desk.js (Api):

	Created missing API method `removePrimarySubBin'.

	Fixed `removeSecondaryBin' actually not deleting bin from fake
	data repository.

2014-08-21  Miguel Guedes  <miguel@miguelguedes.org>

	* all:

	Several improvements to UI interaction made: text item node now
	forcibly selected when more/less link clicked; text item node is
	aligned to top if its height is larger than container; correct
	spacing ensured at bottom when repositioning; other minor
	enhancements.

	A few bugs, most of which introduced recently, were also fixed,
	namely: visually broken d'n'd of large text items; occasional
	vertical flicker when dragging items; enforce a single API request
	per kind; other minor bugs.

	Added UI notification when one or more AJAX requests are taking
	place.

	Implemented creation of secondary or sub bins via dragging and
	dropping of text items onto a 'bin add' button.

	Finalised text rendering algorithm. Component is now fully modular
	and much smarter. In particular, it is now able to skip over HTML
	tags and produces snippets with roughly equal number of chars to
	the left and right of the highlighted text.

	Implement actual deletion of bin elements from UI. Bin containers
	are now reorganised whenever a bin is deleted.

	Created subdirectory `doc' for project-related generic document
	files.

	Reorganised source files into individual subdirectories.

	Various improvements to code.


2014-08-20  Miguel Guedes  <miguel@miguelguedes.org>

	* all:

	Component is now able to retrieve information about primary bin
	from diffeo's RESTful API.

	A title was added to every text item in the form of a link
	(clicking opens a new tab).

	Implemented multi-view, word-bound text rendering
	algorithm. Depending on the current view, a "more" or "less" link
	is displayed which allows for rendering of a condensed or
	unrestricted view of a text item. There might be potentially a bug
	(untested) if the boundaries fall on opened tags (e.g. boundary
	ends after `<b class="foo">'); nothing major though and shouldn't
	affect rendering in any way.

	Component now loads live data from diffeo's RESTful API.

	Added logic for user notification of ongoing AJAX requests.

	A UI control was created that allows for real-time changing of the
	current primary bin's node id. Editing the field and exiting it
	triggers the new primary node id to take effect.

2014-08-14  Miguel Guedes  <miguel@miguelguedes.org>

	* src/SortingDesk.js:

	Created UI interaction logic permitting deletion of all
	non-primary bins. Deletion of bins is done by dragging intended
	bin. Once dragging is initiated a target with an `X' inside will
	pop up. Dropping the bin in to the target deletes it. Note,
	however, that no bins are actually deleted yet. Will be waiting
	approval of current implementation before actual bin removal logic
	is added.

	Separated `bin' and `bin containment' responsibilities. Required
	quite a bit of work.

	Implemented logic enabling interactive creation of bins. Bins are
	created by clicking the appropriate 'add' button and waiting for
	input from the user. If the user moves away from the new bin
	without entering a description/title, creation of the bin is
	cancelled. If a description/title has been entered, hitting TAB or
	ENTER, or moving away from the new bin results in the creation of
	a new bin.

	Reworked mechanism by which bins are created.  There were serious
	presentation issues involving bins whose titles/descriptions
	spanned more than one line.

	Bin animates when an item is assigned via a keyboard shortcut.

	Removed reliance on hardcoded CSS classes.

	* test/css/theme-default.css: Several clean up/improvements of CSS
	styling.
