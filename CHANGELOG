	* test/js/api-sorting_desk.js:

	Add a title to every text item in the form of a link.

	Implemented multi-view, word-bound text rendering
	algorithm. Depending on the current view, a "more" or "less" link
	is displayed which allows for rendering of a condensed or
	unrestricted view of a text item.

	Component now loads live data from diffeo's RESTful API.

	Added logic for user notification of ongoing AJAX requests.

	A UI control was created that allows for real-time changing of the
	current primary bin's node id. Editing the field and exiting it
	triggers the new primary node id to take effect.

	* src/SortingDesk.js:

	Created UI interaction logic permitting deletion of all
	non-primary bins. Deletion of bins is done by dragging intended
	bin. Once dragging is initiated a target with an `X' inside will
	pop up. Dropping the bin in to the target deletes it. Note,
	however, that no bins are actually deleted yet. Will be waiting
	approval of current implementation before actual bin removal logic
	is added.

	Separated `bin' and `bin containment' responsibilities. Required
	quite a bit of work.

	Implemented logic enabling interactive creation of bins. Bins are
	created by clicking the appropriate 'add' button and waiting for
	input from the user. If the user moves away from the new bin
	without entering a description/title, creation of the bin is
	cancelled. If a description/title has been entered, hitting TAB or
	ENTER, or moving away from the new bin results in the creation of
	a new bin.

	Reworked mechanism by which bins are created.  There were serious
	presentation issues involving bins whose titles/descriptions
	spanned more than one line.

	Bin animates when an item is assigned via a keyboard shortcut.

	Removed reliance on hardcoded CSS classes.

	* test/css/theme-default.css: Several clean up/improvements of CSS
	styling.
