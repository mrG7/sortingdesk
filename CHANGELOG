	Further work required to enable/disable the translation toolbar
	button depending on whether a text selection exists; currently the
	button is always enabled.

	The translation service is made available after it has been
	suitably configured.  Configuring the translation service can be
	achieved by accessing the extension's options/preferences window

	translation service and pasting the API key string.  Presently
	only the Google Translate service is available.
