* Generic
** TODO Replace methods with (prefix) string =initialis= for =initializ=

*** TODO Request feedback from Diffeo about other British-isms and use American English variations
This may be of particular concern given the sensitive nature of the project.

** TODO Document code
First iteration would include modules and classes.

** TODO Document required options
=SortingQueue=, =SortingDesk= and possibly other components, could do with documentation about required and optional options, callbacks and so on.

* =SortingDesk=
** =ControllerExplorer=
*** TODO [#A] Why can't an attribute be added in the =SubfolderNew= constructor and accessed in =render=?

*** WAIT Implement keyboard auto-repeat with configurable frequency
- State "WAIT"       from "TODO"       [2014-10-15 Wed 13:56] \\
  Probable unwanted feature.
  
* Examples
** TODO Fix broken examples

** WAIT Create examples [0%]
- State "WAIT"       from "TODO"       [2014-11-25 Tue 06:39] \\
  Not a priority at the moment.
  
*** TODO No content ids

* Tests
** TODO instance: ensure reset doesn't run twice

** TODO instance: require =visibleItems= to be greater than 0

** TODO interface: ensure 'bin add' button is created prior to using it

** TODO interface: ensure correct number of sub-bins are created

** TODO interface: removed test for adding of sub-bin

* Unclassified
** TODO Revamp errors returned via promises to include error *codes*
It is easier for programs to process errors if they are given as a code. Errors in human natural language are only useful to humans, not programs.

** TODO Review data structures
This includes =Sorting Desk='s bin data structure and =Sorting Queue='s item
data structure. Changes to any of the components will require updating the
different API and example source files, as well as dossier.js .

For instance, Sorting Queue expects an item to be composed of the following properties:

+ =raw=: reference to raw structure; probably not needed
+ =node_id=: the item's id
+ =name=: (a sort of) label/tag
+ =url=: URL to point =name= above to
+ =text=: actual item content
+ =title=: optional; appended to =name= above

The above could instead be:

+ =id=
+ =label= (or =tag=)
  - =name=
  - =title=
  - =url=
+ =text=

A similar discussion could be had regarding bins' data structure.

** WAIT Resolve all annotated TODO items
- State "WAIT"       from "TODO"       [2014-10-15 Wed 13:57] \\
  To be done when Sorting Desk has reached a significant milestone.
  
** WAIT Implement user notifications
- State "WAIT"       from "CANCELED"   [2014-11-26 Wed 09:08] \\
  Requires explicit approval.
- State "CANCELED"   from "WAIT"       [2014-10-09 Thu 10:43] \\
  This will have to be implemented by the client via notification of events. Not Sorting Desk's concern.
- State "WAIT"       from "TODO"       [2014-09-05 Fri 11:21] \\
  Need further information.
A mechanism for displaying notifications to the user is needed for the purpose
of providing feedback, in particular in the cases when a user action is invalid
and results in an error.
