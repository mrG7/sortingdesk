* To do items
** *ALL* [0%]
*** TODO Base module
There is a need for base module upon which all existing modules can depend.

*** TODO Mechanism for stopping all ongoing AJAX requests
Behaviour is currently unknown if one switches to a folder while some sort of loading is taking place when the switch occurs (=moreTexts=, getFc=, etc). We need to be able to systematically terminate any and all AJAX requests taking place *before* the switch occurs.

*** TODO Consider using SASS
*** TODO Create standard function that can be assigned to abstract methods
This would enable the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
var _abs_met = function ()
{
  throw "Abstract method not implemented";
};

var MyClass = function () { ... };

MyClass.prototype = {
  anAbstractMethod: _abs_met
};
#+END_SRC

Ideally the =_abs_met_= above would be part of a specific namespace of class utilities, e.g.:

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
var MetaClass = {
  abstract: function ()
  { throw "Abstract method not implemented"; }
};
#+END_SRC  

**** TODO Integrate into module
Parent feature could even be integrated in a module of its own (name suggestion: =Utilitas=, old Latin for “utility”) containing other similar basic utilities/tools (e.g. RFC standards compliant string encode/decode utility), with the Sorting Queue, Desk, and other modules, all depending on it.

In addition, certain classes could be moved into this new module. Examples of this are the =Controller= class that is specialised by various classes in different modules. It doesn't really make sense that, say, the =LabelBrowser= module has to depend on =SortingQueue= just because it requires access to its =Controller= base class; it should depend directly on the utility module suggested here.

*** TODO Implement HTML declarative form as mechanism of assigning context
See Sorting Desk's =LabelBrowser= and how it uses HTML5 =data=-prefixed tags to give DOM nodes a context. Essentially, this mechanism would allow us to avoid forcing the client to pass jQuery object references to DOM nodes needed, thereby simplifying the process. We should still require *either* a reference to a main/container node in a set of different supported types. This main/container node would enable looking up nodes in declarative form within its subtree, thus owned by it, and not globally in the DOM tree, and would make it possible for multiple instances of the component to exist simultaneously. The main/container node could be allowed to specified in the following types:

+ jQuery reference, with only the first element used
  
+ string assumed to be containing its id; or perhaps, for even greater flexibility, the string could be allowed to be *anything* that jQuery *and* =document.querySelector= understand?
  
+ direct reference to an =Element= instance

*Question*: AngularJS uses the prefix =ng-= for its many HTML tags, so not prefixed with =data-=. Perhaps we could mirror this practice and thus not have to rely on HTML5's =data-= prefixed tags as we currently do? Is it a standards compliant way, however?

Follow-up to above: see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12107504/angularjs-tags-attributes; it seems AngularJS *also* accepts =data-= prefixed HTML tags.

*** TODO Do *NOT* allow CSS classes to be specified in =options=
This actually makes no sense and borders on the nonsensical. The assumption should be that the (different) components all use a *fixed* set of CSS classes, which are properly prefixed thus creating a namespace of sorts, which the client can then provide custom styling for. The CSS class names themselves should *not* be allowed to change.

Example:

The HTML element representation of an item, as created by =SortingQueue=, will *always* be given the CSS class =sd-text-item= and this class name can *not* be changed or configured, ever.

*** TODO Replace methods with (prefix) string =initialis= for =initializ=

**** TODO Request feedback from Diffeo about other British-isms and use American English variations
This may be of particular concern given the sensitive nature of the project.

*** TODO Document code
First iteration would include modules and classes.

*** TODO Document required options
=SortingQueue=, =SortingDesk= and possibly other components, could do with documentation about required and optional options, callbacks and so on.

** =SortingQueue= [0%]
*** TODO =ControllerButtonDismiss= already employs a very specific pubsub method (=register=)
This is bad. A generic and extensible mechanism that can be used by *ALL* components should be in place instead.

*** TODO Create controller responsible for constructors
The method =instantiate= should be moved there and a new method  =hasConstructor= created.

*** TODO Rename CSS class names alluding to the old concept of text item
Some CSS class names are still in use which employ the old concept of text item. These should be renamed such that the "text" word is removed.

*** TODO =Droppable=: requires reset method
See =ProtarchBinSpawner=. Specifically, there are instances where the events attached by =Droppable= need to be unbound at destruction time; i.e. when a =Droppable= instance is created on the DOM's own body.

*** TODO =ControllerItems=: disable all other dragging-related events

*** TODO Implement Events controller based on the publisher-subscriber design pattern
- State "TODO"       from "WAIT"       [2015-01-02 Fri 12:49]
- State "WAIT"       from "TODO"       [2014-10-23 Thu 14:42]

This component is sorely needed.

*** TODO Remove code handling keyboard events
  
** =SortingDesk= [0%]
*** =FolderExplorer= [0%]
**** TODO =detachAllEventsIn_=: move to =SortingCommon=?
**** TODO Do not require constructor to =LabelBrowser= component
Trigger an event instead and let client deal with it.

**** TODO Selecting folder should also switch Sorting Desk's active folder but not close window
**** TODO Implement folder renaming
**** TODO Needs a callbacks handler BADLY

*** =LabelBrowser= [12%]
**** TODO Must fire event in the event that the content id's FC could not be fetched
This is so the client can update state should loading of state fail. Right now, if the referential FC fails to load, the Label Browser's window shows the strings "Loading" and "Please wait" because the =Ui= instance isn't aware loading actually failed.

**** TODO =Browser=: should the active =SortingDesk= instance be passed as a stand-alone argument or as part of the =options= object map?

**** TODO Show appropriate message when items list empty
**** TODO =set_heading_title_=: using reference bin's own content rather than snippet from retrieved feature collection
Assess if correct.

Rationale behind decision was so the bins' snippet/image presented actually matched what the user used to create the bin in the first place. After all, a different user could have created a feature collection for the same page, thus replacing its snippet/image.

**** TODO Show labels ungrouped or grouped by feature collection (=content_id=)
**** TODO As it stands there can only be ONE Label Browser HTML container
We can keep the declarative manner in which nodes are found but the component will have to receive a container node so that querying for nodes can be conducted in the container node's subtree.

**** TODO Decouple component from =SortingDesk.js=
Component needs to stand on its own, have its own set of options, callbacks and so on. Being so tightly coupled with the =SortingDesk= module means that currently the =options= structure is logically nonsensical and it is unable to receive notifications for loading events, among other problems.

*** TODO Encode images to base64
Relevant links to research:

+ [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ImageData][ImageData]]
+ [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/934012/get-image-data-in-javascript][Get image data in Javascript]]
+ [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10754661/javascript-getting-imagedata-without-canvas][Getting image data without canvas]]

It basically relies on using the =canvas= element to get the image data. Then, it's just a matter of encoding the image data to base64 and stuff it into the subtopic value for that image. Afterwards it's only a matter of showing the image as a [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/data_URIs][data URI]].

*** TODO Should be using a map to contain bins
Also see TODO about folders being kept in an array.

*** TODO Window management class
A class for managing windows used by the different components is needed so as to prevent code duplication. Currently, the components =LabelBrowser= and =BinExplorer= share (duplicate) functionality that ought to be in a specialised class for this purpose.

*** TODO Revisit =options=
Sorter and Label Browser's options reside together but Sorter's options are not prefixed.

*** TODO =options.nodes.add=
Inconsistency: =buttonDismissed= is prefixed but =add= isn't.

*** TODO Assess whether instance should keep reference to =options= object
Should it rely on =SortingQueue= instead?

*** TODO Throw exception when instantiating if not on valid page
URL of page must have a valid HTTP[S] protocol. Disallow on any other page and throw exception.

*** TODO Allow specialisation of =ControllerButtonDismiss=

*** TODO Tentative: allow =SortingDesk='s constructor to receive a deferred object
Allow the constructor of =SortingDesk= to receive an *optional* deferred object provided, and which is under the responsibility of the user, that can be actioned upon depending on the result of the initialisation sequence.

Ultimately this optional mechanism would allow the client to receive a perfectly timed notification regarding Sorting Desk's initialisation state as and when it happens.

*** TODO =ControllerBinSpawner=: =addManual= can't be supported as it stands
+ API requires knowledge of the bin's =label=.
+ Several TODO annotations have been created regarding this issue.
  
*** WAIT Implement keyboard auto-repeat with configurable frequency
- State "WAIT"       from "TODO"       [2014-10-15 Wed 13:56] \\
  Probable unwanted feature.
  
*** WAIT Do not allow duplicate bins
- State "WAIT"       from "CANCELED"   [2014-11-26 Wed 09:09] \\
  Reissuing TODO item as there is validity in the concept.
- State "CANCELED"   from "WAIT"       [2014-09-04 Thu 13:02] \\
  Most likely can't be done reliably.
- State "WAIT"       from "TODO"       [2014-08-22 Fri 12:44] \\
  Specifications aren't clear as to how bins that are based on existing text items
  are created.

*** TODO Revamp errors returned via promises to include error *codes*
It is easier for programs to process errors if they are given as a code. Errors in human natural language are only useful to humans, not programs.

*** TODO Review data structures
This includes =Sorting Desk='s bin data structure and =Sorting Queue='s item
data structure. Changes to any of the components will require updating the
different API and example source files, as well as dossier.js .

For instance, Sorting Queue expects an item to be composed of the following properties:

+ =raw=: reference to raw structure; probably not needed
+ =node_id=: the item's id
+ =name=: (a sort of) label/tag
+ =url=: URL to point =name= above to
+ =text=: actual item content
+ =title=: optional; appended to =name= above

The above could instead be:

+ =id=
+ =label= (or =tag=)
  - =name=
  - =title=
  - =url=
+ =text=

A similar discussion could be had regarding bins' data structure.

*** TODO Employ use of classes to identify hover state and possibly others
This is meant to resolve the problem that parent elements can't be styled depending on mouse state, such as =:hover=, when nested elements are used. The only way to reliably solve this problem is to rely on CSS classes to signal mouse states.

*** WAIT Resolve all annotated TODO items
- State "WAIT"       from "TODO"       [2014-10-15 Wed 13:57] \\
  To be done when Sorting Desk has reached a significant milestone.
  
*** WAIT Implement user notifications
- State "WAIT"       from "CANCELED"   [2014-11-26 Wed 09:08] \\
  Requires explicit approval.
- State "CANCELED"   from "WAIT"       [2014-10-09 Thu 10:43] \\
  This will have to be implemented by the client via notification of events. Not Sorting Desk's concern.
- State "WAIT"       from "TODO"       [2014-09-05 Fri 11:21] \\
  Need further information.
A mechanism for displaying notifications to the user is needed for the purpose
of providing feedback, in particular in the cases when a user action is invalid
and results in an error.

* Bugs [0%]
** TODO When items' DIV is selected, scrolling with keyboard both selects next item as well as scroll the DIV contents
Scrolling on the items' DIV container must be suppressed.

Note that this might not be possible if the browser does not allow control over the HTML element's focus.

** TODO Wrong items are selected when a list of items contains duplicate items
A possible solution for this is to append a timestamp to each item's id. Even though each HTML node's id would be unique, they would each refer to the same item datum.

** TODO =Droppable=: =reset= clearing *all* events
This could be undesirable since all the events attached to the element are cleared, including any events the client may have set up.
