First iteration would include modules and classes.

*** TODO Rename CSS class names alluding to the old concept of text item
Some CSS class names are still in use which employ the old concept of text item. These should be renamed such that the "text" word is removed.
*** TODO =Droppable=: requires reset method
See =ProtarchBinSpawner=. Specifically, there are instances where the events attached by =Droppable= need to be unbound at destruction time; i.e. when a =Droppable= instance is created on the DOM's own body.

** =SortingDesk= [25%]
*** TODO Allow specialisation of =ControllerButtonDismiss=
*** TODO Tentative: allow =SortingDesk='s constructor to receive a deferred object
Allow the constructor of =SortingDesk= to receive an *optional* deferred object provided, and which is under the responsibility of the user, that can be actioned upon depending on the result of the initialisation sequence.

Ultimately this optional mechanism would allow the user to receive perfectly timed notifications regarding Sorting Desk's initialisation state as and when they happen.
*** TODO =ControllerBins=: =onItemDropped= unused
*** TODO =ControllerBinSpawner=: =addManual= can't be supported as it stands
+ API requires knowledge of the bin's =label=.
+ Several TODO annotations have been created regarding this issue.
*** TODO Display of the bins should be minimal
Ideally, each bin should look like the item that was first dropped to create that bin.
*** TODO [#B] Prefix bins' node ids

*** WAIT [#A] Allow bin statements to be edited
- State "WAIT"       from "TODO"       [2014-10-10 Fri 16:11] \\

*** TODO Revamp errors returned via promises to include error *codes*
It is easier for programs to process errors if they are given as a code. Errors in human natural language are only useful to humans, not programs.
*** TODO Review data structures
This includes =Sorting Desk='s bin data structure and =Sorting Queue='s item
data structure. Changes to any of the components will require updating the
different API and example source files, as well as dossier.js .

For instance, Sorting Queue expects an item to be composed of the following properties:

+ =raw=: reference to raw structure; probably not needed
+ =node_id=: the item's id
+ =name=: (a sort of) label/tag
+ =url=: URL to point =name= above to
+ =text=: actual item content
+ =title=: optional; appended to =name= above

The above could instead be:

+ =id=
+ =label= (or =tag=)
  - =name=
  - =title=
  - =url=
+ =text=

A similar discussion could be had regarding bins' data structure.
*** TODO Employ use of classes to identify hover state and possibly others
This is meant to resolve the problem that parent elements can't be styled depending on mouse state, such as =:hover=, when nested elements are used. The only way to reliably solve this problem is to rely on CSS classes to signal mouse states.
*** WAIT Resolve all annotated TODO items
- State "WAIT"       from "TODO"       [2014-10-15 Wed 13:57] \\
  To be done when Sorting Desk has reached a significant milestone.
*** WAIT [#C] Implement user notifications
- State "WAIT"       from "CANCELED"   [2014-11-26 Wed 09:08] \\
  Requires explicit approval.
- State "CANCELED"   from "WAIT"       [2014-10-09 Thu 10:43] \\
  This will have to be implemented by the client via notification of events. Not Sorting Desk's concern.
- State "WAIT"       from "TODO"       [2014-09-05 Fri 11:21] \\
  Need further information.
A mechanism for displaying notifications to the user is needed for the purpose
of providing feedback, in particular in the cases when a user action is invalid
and results in an error.
* Bugs [0%]
** TODO When items' DIV is selected, scrolling with keyboard both selects next item as well as scroll the DIV contents
Scrolling on the items' DIV container must be suppressed.

Note that this might not be possible if the browser does not allow control over the HTML element's focus.

** TODO Wrong items are selected when a list of items contains duplicate items
A possible solution for this is to append a timestamp to each item's id. Even though each HTML node's id would be unique, they would each refer to the same item datum.

** TODO =Droppable=: =reset= clearing *all* events
This could be undesirable since all the events attached to the element are cleared, including any events the client may have set up.
