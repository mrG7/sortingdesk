1. perhaps create a very condensed view that shows only the text inside the _first_ bold tag.
2. another view might be to show only text inside bold tags with perhaps a few words left and right.
3. include a /more/ button that shows the full text.

According to the layout above, there would a total of 3 different ways a text item could be displayed: condensed => highlights => unrestricted.

Some notes:

+ Text items can be found in =sentences=.
+ Bins' names are in the =NAME= property.
+ Sub-bins are created through user interaction.
+ Primary bin =node_id= for testing:
  Default: =kb_aHR0cHM6Ly9rYi5kaWZmZW8uY29tL2FsX2FocmFt=
  This seems faster: =kb_aHR0cHM6Ly9rYi5kaWZmZW8uY29tL2FsX2FocmFt=

*Main priority* is to have real data exposed in the UI.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Inside the "features" object of each result are many smaller objects.  There is an object called "abs_url" that will generally have one value, and you should use this as the URL for displaying a hyperlink in each item in the queue.

The text to use as anchor text in each item should be the longest string in the "NAME" feature followed by the only string in the "title" feature. The "title" feature might not be present.  The NAME feature will always be present.

** DONE Allow primary bin's =node id= to be changed

Add an input box in the UI that users can edit.
** CANCELED [#C] Implement user notifications
- State "CANCELED"   from "WAIT"       [2014-10-09 Thu 10:43] \\
  This will have to be implemented by the client via notification of events. Not Sorting Desk's concern.
- State "WAIT"       from "TODO"       [2014-09-05 Fri 11:21] \\
  Need further information.
A mechanism for displaying notifications to the user is needed for the purpose
of providing feedback, in particular in the cases when a user action is invalid
and results in an error.
** CANCELED [#B] Do not allow duplicate bins
- State "CANCELED"   from "WAIT"       [2014-09-04 Thu 13:02] \\
  Most likely can't be done reliably.
- State "WAIT"       from "TODO"       [2014-08-22 Fri 12:44] \\
  Specifications aren't clear as to how bins that are based on existing text items
  are created.
** CANCELED =Bin= and =BinContainer= classes take an =id= parameter
- State "CANCELED"   from "TODO"       [2014-08-22 Fri 13:22] \\
  The structure of a bin is awkward with the object itself not actually having a property representing its id. The object is instead pointed to by a key that itself is the id. There's no other way but to keep the id separate, unless we chose to implement different semantics, which I'm not happy about.
Why? Shouldn't that be in =bin= instead?
** CANCELED Assess JS and CSS needs of different types of data

  #BEGIN_QUOTE
  No need.  What you have is great.  We may want to revisit it later with several other features.
  #END_QUOTE
  
It was stated that "other types come from other sources including Facebook profiles, database records like MusicBrainz, and more", and that "the JS and HTML and CSS for displaying result should become more configurable and pluggable".
