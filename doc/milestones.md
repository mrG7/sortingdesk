====================

 * browser extension that enables basic CONOPS for user stories. 

 * refine JavaScript APIs between three subsystems: 
   1. foldering system,
   2. highlighting
   3. dossier.label

 * create in-browser highlighting, so that uses can easily highlight
   anything they see.  When user returns to a page, the highlights
   re-appear.  Each subfolder is a different colored highlighter.

 * enable easy exploration of gathered content in something like a
   photo gallery

 * create social features for collaborating in groups on folders

 * (pay down technical debt of rapidly inventing previous milestones)
